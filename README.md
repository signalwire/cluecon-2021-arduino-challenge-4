# Cluecon 2021 Arduino Challenge 4
Using an Arduino board, and send a text message and a phone call based off our example code. You can use your imagination and any code snippets provided to aid in your quest.   There are many different ways to solve the objective, Be creative and have fun with it!


## About Cluecon 2021 Arduino Challenge 4
For this challenge you will demonstrate your technical skills to send and receive a call and sms message using an Arduino.

Our examples will show you how to test the resistance, and temperature or water. However, feel free to go further, and test other factors related to purity.

## Getting Started
- [x] Arduino IDE
- [x] Putty or Similar for opening serial port
- [x] Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 or Similar
- [x] Micro USB Cable

## Cluecon 2021 Arduino Challenge 4 - How It Works
We demostrate how to connect to a WiFi Access Point, Create Simple Web Server to handle requests, and a simple HttpClient to comunication with SignalWire REST Api.

## Let's Get Started 
Prepare Your Coding Enviroment
1. Install Arduio IDE 
- [Installing Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/windows)
2. Then open and goto Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager
3. Type in 'MKR' and make sure that 'Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+)' is Installed, If not click install
